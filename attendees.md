Please find on this page information regarding ASAB Spring 2024 conference and/or Exeter University's policy on code of conduct, equality, families, accessibility, social media, and sustainability.
Conference attendees with any concerns or comments regarding the information below should e-mail us or speak to a conference organiser (in confidence) in the first instance.
Code of Conduct
We are committed to making this conference productive and enjoyable for all. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. If you have a concern, e-mail us or speak to a conference organiser. Presenters/authors must declare that all work has been carried out in accordance with ASAB/ABS’s Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Research.
Equality
As a small conference event we firstly, seek to challenge ourselves and the ASAB community to ensure an environment of mutual concern and respect for all individuals. Secondly, we strive to achieve appropriate representation of women and men in line with the gender balance in our research community in all aspects of the ASAB Conference.
Families
ASAB awards Childcare Grants of up to £500. The awards are designed to provide a flexible contribution towards the additional costs of conference attendance faced by members with young children 
ASAB Spring 2024 allow baby-wearing in all areas and welcome children and caregivers under supervision. (Please see Exeter University’s Health and Safety policy regarding children and young persons). A comfortable nursing space and baby-changing facilities are also available. Attendees are invited to provide details of children and/or care-givers attending when completing registration. A member of the organising committee may then contact you to seek further information.
Accessibility
The venue has wheelchair access and lifts. Attendees are invited to give accessibility or disability information when completing registration and may be contacted by a member of the organising committee to discuss support arrangements that may be needed. ASAB Spring 2024 will ensure that the needs of all attendees are met.

•	Tag @CRABExeter
•	Tweet (or communicate on other social media) about what you are hearing and learning at #ASABExeter, but refrain from sharing when the speaker explicitly requests you do so.

•	E-mail us or speak to a conference organiser (in confidence) in the first instance if you have any concerns or comments regarding the use of social media.
Don't
•	Bully, harass, or be rude to any individual or group.

•	Post images or re-distribute slides or data where the presenter has indicated “no social media”; such a symbol indicates that sharing may preclude subsequent publication of the data, embargo policies, or similar.
