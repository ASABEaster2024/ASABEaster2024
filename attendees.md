Conference attendees with any concerns or comments regarding the information below should e-mail us or speak to a conference organiser (in confidence) in the first instance.</p>

<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>We are committed to making this conference productive and enjoyable for all. We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. If you have a concern, e-mail us or speak to a conference organiser. </p><p>Presenters/authors must declare that all work has been carried out in accordance with ASAB/ABS’s <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347222002469">Guidelines for the Treatment of Animals in Research.</a></p>
<h3>Equality</h3>
<p>As a small conference event we seek to ensure an environment of mutual concern and respect for all individuals. We strive to achieve appropriate representation of women and men in line with the gender balance in our research community in all aspects of the ASAB Conference.</p>
<h3>Families</h3>
<p>ASAB awards <a href="https://www.asab.org/childcare">Childcare Grants</a> of up to £500. The awards are designed to provide a flexible contribution towards the additional costs of conference attendance faced by members with young children.</p>
<p>The University of Exeter allows baby-wearing in all areas and welcome children  under supervision (Please see <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/departments/ucs/healthandsafety/">Exeter University’s Health and Safety policy regarding children and young persons</a>). The university supports breastfeeding in any part of any building, so mothers can feel free to feed their child wherever suits them. For those that would like privacy, comfortable nursing spaces with baby-changing facilities are also available. The nearest (<5 mins walk) is room D.01.01 next to the Info Point on Level One of the Forum. The room is equipped with a nursing chair, bed, fridge, sink, low lighting and task lighting. Visitors should contact <a href="mailto:universityreception@exeter.ac.uk">the main university reception</a> to obtain the access code in advance of the meeting. </p>
<p>Attendees are invited to provide details of children and/or care-givers attending by email to the organising committee. A member of the organising committee may then contact you to seek further information.</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/campusservices/eventexeter/pdfs/Peter_Chalk_factsheet.pdf"> venue (pdf)</a> is fully step-free wheelchair accessible, with an accessible toilet next to the meeting rooms.
