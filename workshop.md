<p>This yearâ€™s ASAB Spring workshop will focus on AI. The day will consist of three sessions that will allow those attending to get an insight into how scientists may use AI to advance their research in animal behaviour. </p>

<p>You are invited to bring your own data and use AI to put together the outline of a paper on the day. You will be working in groups, so you should be prepared to share your data with the group. </p>

<p>If you do not bring data, you can use some of ours. </p>
