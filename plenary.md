<h4>Cooperation in bottlenose dolphins</h4>
<p>Stephanie is an Associate Professor in Animal Behaviour at the University of Bristol where she heads the cetacean communication and cognition research group. She  was extensive experience designing and implementing ambitious field-based experiments to study animal social cognition in the wild. Her primary research focus is on the evolution of complex communication systems and cooperative strategies in bottlenose dolphins, and she is the principal investigator of Shark Bay Dolphin Research, a 40-year study on dolphin behavioural ecology.</p>

<h3>Prof Sigrunn Eliassen (University of Bergen) </h3>

<h4>TBA</h4>
<p>Sigrunn Eliassen is a professor in evolutionary ecology at the Department of biological sciences, University of Bergen, Norway. She is also an Excellent Teaching Practitioner with special interest in research-based teaching and is currently Vice Dean of Education at the Science faculty. Eliassen’s research focuses on the evolution of mating systems and cooperative behaviours. Using evolutionary modelling, she studies how mating strategies change the incentives of males and females to invest in parental care and cooperation within a group. She is also interested in how animals use information and learn. With colleagues, she has studied mechanisms of decision-making and developed a new framework for behavioural modelling.</p>

<h3>Prof Tom Treganza (University of Exeter)</h3>

<h4>TBA</h4>
<p>Tom’s research is about how natural and sexual selection operate in the wild.  For the last 15 years most of this research has been based in the WildCrickets meadow, which he has developed to study selection on the behaviour and life-histories of an insect in its natural habitat.  The approach is to individually mark every cricket in the population and then observe every detail of their adult lives using a network of ~140 infra-red CCTV cameras.  Observations of matings, fights, predation events and so-on are combined with DNA fingerprinting of subsequent generations to measure fitness consequences of behaviours and life-history strategies.  WildCrickets has provided insights into why females mate with so many males, how even short-lived insects senesce as they age and how selection varies among years. Tom is Professor of Evolutionary Ecology at the Centre for Ecology and Conservation at Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall.</p>

<h3>Coffee meet-ups</h3>
<h4>Chats with members of the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour, Exeter</h4>
<p>During the morning coffee breaks (24th  and 25th April), conference participants have opportunity to meet some of the researchers of the Centre for Research in Animal Behaviour at Exeter.   
If you would like to have a chat over coffee with any of the CRAB members listed below, then send us <a href="mailto:ASABSpring2024@gmail.com" target="_blank">an email</a> with the subject “ASAB Spring 2024 coffee meetup", telling us which members you’d like to chat with. We expect that each member will attend one of these meet-ups during the conference, with everyone who expressed an interest in meeting them. </p>
